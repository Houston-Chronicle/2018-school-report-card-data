# School Report Card 
How are schools in the Houston region faring? The Houston Chronicle compiled Children At Risk data to find out. [Go here to see our whole project.](http://projects.houstonchronicle.com/schoolreportcard/)  
     
## What we were looking for? 

The goal was to show how regional schools did year-over-year and make that available to Houston Chronicle readers.  

## How did we do it? 
Children At Risk, a Houston-based policy advocacy group, publishes annual ratings of academic performance at all Texas public schools, assigning a grade and rank to each campus. To calculate the ratings, Children At Risk uses raw scores and student progress scores on the state's standardized math and reading tests. The organization also factors in the percentage of students deemed "economically disadvantaged" by the state when assigning a ranking, seeking to level the playing field between higher- and lower-income schools. Using that data, Children At Risk evenly weights the three factors -- raw test scores (33%), student progress (33%), and expected performance relative to student demographics (33%) – to arrive at a grade and ranking.

This year, Children At Risk made three significant changes to its methodology. First, it used a lower standard for measuring raw student achievement, switching from "masters grade level" on the state test to "meets grade level." Second, it more evenly weighted the three factors. In previous years, raw test scores accounted for 60% of a school's rating, and student progress and expected performance accounted for 20% each. Third, it eliminated its curve for assigning letter grades. In the past, Children At Risk ensured a set percentage of schools received each letter grade (25% were "A," 20% were "B," "C," and "D" each, 15% were "F"). This year, the organization set performance cutoffs for each grade level, resulting in an unpredictable grade distribution. The result: fewer "A" and "F" schools, but more "B," "C" and "D" schools.

The Children At Risk ratings are different than ratings issued by the Texas Education Agency. The state, which only assigns ratings of "met standard" and "improvement required," will begin issuing letter grades next year.

With this in mind, the Chronicle took the last four years’ worth of data they had on schools (2015-2018) and joined them together based on whether or not the school was in the 2018 Children at Risk dataset. If the school was in that dataset, the Chronicle joined it to previous years' datasets based on state rank, region rank and grade.  

If the school did not appear in previous datasets, the Chronicle marked those values as N/A. If a school appeared in previous years, but not in 2018, then it does not appear in the combined dataset. 

## Are there limits to this dataset? 
Yes. The Chronicle only used Children At Risk data, which is subject to their methodology and the data they collect. The Chronicle also only combined datasets from 2015-2018, and nothing earlier. The combined data also only includes comparisons for state rank, regional rank and grade. There are no year-over-year comparisons for test scores or graduation rates yet. The Chronicle will be adding on to this dataset in the future.
